# Project Overview

## Product Statement
**lang-tools** is a foundational JavaScript library that extends `lang-mini` with reactive data models, collections, and vector math utilities, enabling developers to build event-driven, type-safe applications with minimal boilerplate.

## User Archetypes
1.  **The Framework Architect**: Needs low-level, reliable primitives (like B+ Trees and reactive values) to build complex UI frameworks or state management systems without reinventing the wheel.
2.  **The Data Visualization Engineer**: Requires efficient vector math and batch operations (`collective`) to manipulate thousands of DOM elements or canvas objects performantly.
3.  **The Legacy Maintainer**: Values stability and clear migration paths, needing a library that supports modern reactive patterns while maintaining backward compatibility with older `Data_Object` structures.

## The Movie Trailer
(Cue deep, cinematic bass drop)
In a world where JavaScript state is a chaotic mess of spaghetti code and silent failures... one library rises to bring order.
(Fast cuts of code snippets: `Data_Value`, `Collection`, `v_add`)
From the depths of `lang-mini` comes a power unlike any other. It doesn't just store data... it *reacts*. It *validates*. It *syncs*.
(Voiceover shifts to a whisper)
Imagine arrays that speak to you. Numbers that refuse to be strings. Vectors that calculate themselves.
(Epic orchestral swell)
**lang-tools**.
Build faster. Debug less. And finally... let your data tell its own story.
(Fade to black. Text appears: `npm install lang-tools`)

## AI Video Generation Prompts
*Use these prompts with video generation tools like Sora, Runway Gen-2, or Pika Labs to create the visual trailer.*

### Scene 1: The Chaos
**Prompt:** "Abstract digital chaos, tangled glowing wires and glitching code text on a dark background, matrix style but messy and red, cinematic lighting, 4k."
**Audio Cue:** Discordant electronic noise.

### Scene 2: The Hero Arrives
**Prompt:** "A glowing blue geometric structure emerging from the chaos, organizing the wires into straight, orderly lines. The structure is crystalline and emits a pulse of light. Sci-fi aesthetic, clean and modern."
**Audio Cue:** Deep bass drop and a clear, resonant hum.

### Scene 3: Reactive Data
**Prompt:** "Close up of a futuristic dashboard interface. Numbers and graphs are updating instantly in sync with a rhythmic pulse. Blue and cyan color palette. The text 'REACTIVE' appears in holographic 3D letters."
**Audio Cue:** Rhythmic, high-tech interface beeps syncing with the music.

### Scene 4: Vector Math
**Prompt:** "3D visualization of mathematical vectors (arrows) moving in perfect unison, combining and separating fluidly. Mathematical formulas floating in the air, glowing gold. Elegant and precise motion."
**Audio Cue:** Orchestral swell, fast-paced strings.

### Scene 5: The Title Card
**Prompt:** "The text 'lang-tools' forming from particles of light against a deep space background. Minimalist and bold font. Lens flare effect."
**Audio Cue:** Final epic chord and fade out.
