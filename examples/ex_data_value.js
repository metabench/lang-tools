// Data_Value should
//  1) Hold a value (or represent it maybe???)
//  2) Have .change event, raise it when the value changes.



// Data_Value that works as a specific type?

// Maybe need some lower-level lang-mini improved support of data types.
//   It has Grammar.
//   See about fairly comprehensive improvements on that level, or at least a simple way to support a very convenient API.

// here want new Data_Value(value, 'int') for example. Specifying with strings avoids having to get / import various refs as consts.

// could maybe do const Integer = 'int' etc ....

// use lang-mini.Functional_Data_Type
